#+TITLE: failed open/closed

Consider https://gadgetopia.com/post/1773.

A system could be processing data and encounter an error. It has two options:

* Failing closed
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       27b9ea40-3f47-4d5e-8ed8-619ad3d60cf2
:END:
The process can stop all further processing and drop future. This is like if a
door system fails, and the door seals.
* Failing open
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       76a5e063-296c-4db8-ae18-fc8f241727ad
:END:
The process can drop that request, but attempt to continue processing other
systems. More accessible, but less secure.
